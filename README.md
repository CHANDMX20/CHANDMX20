# Network Modeling for Bacterial Communities

## File : SPIEC-EASI.rmd 
This is an R code file that consists of a generic code for generating a SPIEC-EASI network for bacterial communities using 16S seqeuncing data. The code also consists of some algorithms to calculate network statistics properties like modularity, transitivity, centrality, etc.
