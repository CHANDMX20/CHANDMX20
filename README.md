# Network Modeling for Bacterial Communities

### This is a part of my summer project with Dr. Emily Davenport from the Pennsylvania State University where we tried coming up with a model to study the disease dynamics in individuals. We used the TwinsUK dataset for this project

## File : SPIEC-EASI.rmd 
This is an R code file that consists of a generic code for generating a SPIEC-EASI network for bacterial communities using 16S seqeuncing data. The code also consists of some algorithms to calculate network statistics properties like modularity, transitivity, centrality, etc.

## File: SPIEC-EASI network.png
This file consists of the network generated through the modeling technique
