# Network Modeling for Bacterial Communities

### This is a part of my summer project with Dr. Emily Davenport from the Pennsylvania State University where we tried coming up with a model to study the disease dynamics in individuals. We used the TwinsUK dataset for this project

## File : SPIEC-EASI.rmd 
This is code file that consists of a generic code for generating a SPIEC-EASI network for bacterial communities using 16S seqeuncing data. 

## File: SPIEC-EASI_statistics.rmd
This code file is still in process and it consists of algortihms to calcluate and visualize some network statistics properties like odularity, transitivity, centrality, etc.

## File: SPIEC-EASI network.png
This file consists of the network generated by the modeling technique
